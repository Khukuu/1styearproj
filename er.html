                    • Create your Own Character
                    In addition to customizing the appearance of your character, you can freely combine the weapons, armor, and magic that you equip.

                    • An Epic Drama Born from a Myth
                    A multilayered story told in fragments. An epic drama in which the various thoughts of the characters intersect in the Lands Between.
                    
                    • Unique Online Play that Loosely Connects You to Others
                    In addition to multiplayer, where you can directly connect with other players and travel together, the game supports a unique asynchronous online element that allows you to feel the presence of others.
