            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p><b>Q: What is the future of this website?</b></p>
            <p>A: As the current selection of games are very limited, it will hinder the lifespan of the website. As a developer I would like to see the website grows and lives for a long time. With this in mind, I am working towards letting users sell their own games on the site securely.</p>
            <p><b>Q: Will I be able to sell my own games?</b></p>
            <p>A: As of the moment no, but we are happy to be working in order to provide you that service.</p>
            <p><b>Q: Do you sell PC games?</b></p>
            <p>A: We only sell PS4 games as PC games are most of the time digital copy and we do not have the liscence to resell digital copy of games. Please refer to your preferred game store on your PC like Steam or Epic, I am sorry.</p>
