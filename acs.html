                    London, 1868. The Industrial Revolution unleashes an age of invention, transforming the lives of millions with technologies once thought impossible. But industrialization only fattens the purses of a privileged few, while workers struggle to survive in the factories that make London the beating heart of the global economy— until an Assassin rallies to their defense, sparking an epic conflict that will echo throughout history. Create the world’s first organized crime family. Conquer the streets of London. Bring the ruling class to their knees. And rise to lead the London underworld in a visceral adventure unlike anything you've played before.</p>
                <h2>About this game</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>London, 1868. In the heart of the Industrial Revolution, lead your underworld organization and grow your influence to fight those who exploit the less privileged in the name of progress:

                    Champion justice
                    As Jacob Frye, a young and reckless Assassin, use your skills to help those trampled by the march of progress. From freeing exploited children used as slave labour in factories, to stealing precious assets from enemy boats, you will stop at nothing to bring justice back to London’s streets.
                    
                    Command London’s underworld
                    To reclaim London for the people, you will need an army. As a gang leader, strengthen your stronghold and rally rival gang members to your cause, in order to take back the capital from the Templars’ hold.
                    
                    A new dynamic fighting system
                    In Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, action is fast-paced and brutal. As a master of combat, combine powerful multi-kills and countermoves to strike your enemies down.
                    
                    A whole new arsenal
                    Choose your own way to fight enemies. Take advantage of the Rope Launcher technology to be as stealthy as ever and strike with your Hidden Blade. Or choose the kukri knife and the brass knuckles to get the drop on your enemies.
                    
                    A new age of transportation
                    In London, the systemic vehicles offer an ever-changing environment. Drive carriages to chase your target, use your parkour skills to engage in epic fights atop high-speed trains, or make your own way amongst the boats of the River Thames.
                    
                    A vast open world
                    Travel the city at the height of the Industrial Revolution and meet iconic historical figures. From Westminster to Whitechapel, you will come across Darwin, Dickens, Queen Victoria… and many more.
                    
                    A sharper focus
                    Take aim, engage in combat or launch a grappling hook by keeping your target in sight with Tobii Eye Tracking. The Clean UI lets you focus on the matter at hand while the Extended View and Dynamic Light features increase your immersion, making you dive even deeper into the thrilling adventure in the streets of London.
                    Compatible with all Tobii Eye Tracking gaming devices.
