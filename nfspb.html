                <hr>
                <p>Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. From insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw-dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed Payback delivers an edge-of-your-seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.

                    Key Features:
                    Scrap to stock to supercar. Your car is at the center of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback. Endlessly fine-tune your performance with each of the five distinct car classes (Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag and Runner) to turn the tables on the competition in any race, mission or challenge.
                    Live out an action-driving fantasy. Play as three distinct characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons and deserts.
                    High stakes competition. Win big with all-new Risk vs Reward gameplay. Intense cop chases mean the stakes have never been higher. Challenge your friends or potential rivals via Autolog recommendations throughout the events or go head-to-head in classic online leaderboards.
