                <p>You are Geralt of Rivia, mercenary monster slayer. Before you stands a war-torn, monster-infested continent you can explore at will. Your current contract? Tracking down Ciri — the Child of Prophecy, a living weapon that can alter the shape of the world.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Wild Hunt has been enhanced with numerous visual and technical improvements, including vastly improved level of detail, a range of community created and newly developed mods for the game, real-time ray tracing, and more — all implemented with the power of modern PCs in mind.



                    Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength, and reflexes, witchers are a counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Gruesomely destroy foes as a professional monster hunter armed with a range of upgradeable weapons, mutating potions, and combat magic.</li>
                        <li>Hunt down a wide variety of exotic monsters, from savage beasts prowling mountain passes to cunning supernatural predators lurking in the shadowy back alleys of densely populated cities.</li>
                        <li>Invest your rewards to upgrade your weaponry and buy custom armor, or spend them on horse races, card games, fist fighting, and other pleasures life brings.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <P>Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth, and complexity.</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves, and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains, and seas.</li>
                        <li>Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches, and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services.</li>
                        <li>Make choices that go beyond good & evil, and face their far-reaching consequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Take on the most important contract of your life: to track down the child of prophecy, the key to saving or destroying this world.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends.</li>
                        <li>Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds, and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world.</li>
                        <li>Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving.</li>
                    </ul>
